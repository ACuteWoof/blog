I recently received the Samson sr850 headphones that I ordered a few weeks ago from AliExpress, and my friends suggested I try to listen to FLACs using them, as this was my first time owning audio gear that supports high fidelity audio playback.

Being the person I am, I didn't want to purchase separate album CDs and a CD player just to listen to FLACs, so I decided to look for a way to download FLACs. The piracy sites that my friends suggested were either down or didn't have the albums I was looking for in 24 bit, so I decided to look for a way to find services like Spotify but for Hi Fi audio.

After hours of unironically wasting my time on the deep dark internet, I found out that Tidal's Hi Fi Plus had a 30-day free trial (or $4 for 60 days). I had been aware of Tidal before, but the cost had been a barrier for me, so I never really looked into it.

A few hours later, I also discovered a project on Github called [tidal-tdl](https://github.com/yaronzz/Tidal-Media-Downloader), which was also on the AUR (Arch User Repository). This project allowed me to download FLACs from Tidal, which was exactly what I was looking for.

I left my computer on overnight to download the FLACs for the albums I wanted, and when I woke up, I had an entire directory of FLACs.

This probably isn't legal, but I'm not in the mindset to care. I'm just glad I can listen to FLACs without having to pay for them.

Side note: If Tidal doesn't work for your country, you can use a VPN to sign up and then use your account without a VPN, and don't forget to cancel your subscription before the trial ends.
