So this blog was actually supposed to be something where I didn't have to rebuild the site everytime I wanted to write a post, but my laziness directed me to the Next.JS guides where the tech jargon misled me to building this, which is basically a Next.JS site with posts written in markdown, compiled at **build time**. This is not how I wanted it to work but eh, it works. I'll probably make a new blog with the features I want in the future, but for now, this is what I have. I'll probably write a post about how I accidentally made this site in the future, but for now, I'm just gonna leave this here.

Now that you've looked at what I've definitely put hours of effort into, how about you [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/acutewoof)? â˜•
